# JSMinigames (JSMG)

An Online Multiplayer üïπÔ∏è Based on JavaScript-Style Minigames

## Background

The inspiration of this project came from the idea that learning to code can be fun. There are many adoptations of this idea that embody this spirit, however what I found is that these implementations usually seemed "uninnovative", where others like "CSSBattles" (and a few) weren't. That is when I came up with a game that involves competiting against other JS coders in real-time, and at first I thought this "wouldn't work" since it may be too confusing or that people would find this boring - I went with it anyway! JSMinigames (JSMG) was born and I vision that this project will grow for years to come with much more content and users.
